# sonos-sleep-well
A Sonos watcher which controls a volume of the music

## Usage
When someone bothers you with a loud music on a Saturday night at Negev - go downstairs and join the party!  
If you don't want to - go back to sleep! Only if you can not - run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

If you are not familiar with `yarn` - google and install it!  
If you are lazy - run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Sleep well :-)
